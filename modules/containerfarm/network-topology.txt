In srvctl3 we use a single class A network 10.x.x.x for communication of containers and hosts.
This network is devided to 16 subnets. netmask: 255.240.0.0 or /12

10.0.0.0 - 10.15.255.255 - reserved for external networks and openvpn connections outside of srvctl
10.16.0.0 - 10.31.255.255 - HOSTNET 1
10.32.0.0 - 10.47.255.255 - HOSTNET 2
...
10.240.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 - HOSTNET 15

Bridges use a 10.b.b.x/24 (255.255.255.0) address space. That means 4080 bridges per hostnet. 

We divide users and assign them to 16 resellers.
That means we can have up to 16 servers, each hosting for 16 resellers.
Resellers have ~250 users on each server. Each user can have ~200 containers on each server.
